"This project is a data-modeling practice exercise based on the Sample Superstore dataset. The goal of the project was not to create a full Power BI dashboard, but to focus specifically on preparing the data, applying transformations, fixing data quality issues, and building accurate relationships between tables.
The project demonstrates the essential steps required before creating any reports or visuals, making it useful for learning and improving Power BI data-modeling skills."
